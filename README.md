## Project Details:

This project contains software artifacts related to the construction of an energy sustainability-oriented smart network slicing layer. Using artificial intelligence, it is possible to choose a good target domain to deploy the network slice in order to minimize energy consumption.

## SFI2 Project experiments

This repository contains the code artifacts and dataset to simulate eletricity consumption in Target Domains managed by [SFI2 Reference Architecture](https://sites.google.com/view/sfi2/home). To reproduce this snipet it is mandatory to install some requirements as described in file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/romoreira/SFI2-Energy-Sustainability/blob/master/requirements.txt)

1. Run the [launch.sh](https://github.com/romoreira/SFI2-Energy-Sustainability/blob/master/requirements.txt) file available in this repository
2. `./lauch.sh`
> Note inside [launch.sh](https://github.com/romoreira/SFI2-Energy-Sustainability/blob/4538ee42e05f9a6c8447c13ce08ef77cf389697f/launch.sh) has the call of client python scripts, and some parameters is provided.
